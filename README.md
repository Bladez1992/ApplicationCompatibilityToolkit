This is simply a port of both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/application-compatibility-toolkit--act-) (ACT) that installs and actually works on Windows 10 + 11 - it functions exactly the same as it did on Windows 7/8. Microsoft took steps to block this from running on Windows 10+ at some point (presumably due to switching to the [ADK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/yongrhee/download-windows-10-assessment-and-deployment-kit-adk)) which is why I made this!
